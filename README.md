# 🖱️ Laya’s Hackpad (Custom Macropad)

A custom-built **4-key macropad** designed for coding shortcuts, powered by **Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040**, with a fully 3D-printed case and KMK firmware.
honestly this was my first ever hardware project where i used the pcb editon and fusion 360 it was fun i had to google a lot of things and i tried to draw doreamon on back of my 
case it didnt extract well although i was succesfull in drawing a small robo on my pcb anyways i will continue working and learning abt it more this project taught me a lot than my traditional education could ever do
